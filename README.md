# GitHub_Codespace

Welcome to the **GitHub Codespace** project! 

In this project, we will leverage the power of **GitHub Codespaces** to design and generate a range of **UML diagrams** for a **Library Management System**. These diagrams will include use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and more, providing a comprehensive blueprint for the system's architecture.

Stay tuned for updates and contributions as we build this project collaboratively!
